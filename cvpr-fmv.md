link: https://fmv-cvpr24workshop.github.io/


## About

The rapid growth of foundation models in various domains has been transformative, bringing unprecedented capabilities and advances in automated understanding. Medical vision, a pivotal segment of computer vision, is poised to greatly benefit from these advancements. This workshop delves into the integration and application of foundation models specific to the realm of medical imaging. We will cover state-of-the-art techniques for diverse medical data, such as echocardiogram, fundus, pathology, and radiology, as well as the practical challenges of implementing these models in clinical settings. Through expert-led sessions, interactive discussions, and international competitions, we aim to offer attendees a comprehensive understanding of the potential impact foundation models could have on the future of medical diagnostics and patient care.
